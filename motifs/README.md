# Motifs

This package performs motif calling, clustering and enrichment. JASPAR2024 is used as the PWM dataset, and MOODS is used for motif calling. Spearman's rank is used for motif significance testing.


## Code
- [Run MOODS](motifs/run_moods.py): Performs motif calling using MOODS on custom fasta files for each of the fragments (and additionally for the Olig2 CRE). Fasta files are found in *reference/fasta*.
- [Motif Clustering](motifs/motif_clustering.py): Uses similarity metrics generated by JASPAR2024 to perform agglomerative clustering to establish a set of motif 'archetypes'. Archetypes are recorded in reference/archetypes.csv
- [Motif Enrichment](motifs/motif_enrichment.py): Performs motif enrichment analysis on logFC ZsGreen âˆ†SAG via Spearman's rank.
